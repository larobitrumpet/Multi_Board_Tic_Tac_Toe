# Multi Board Tic Tac Toe With AI
This is a project that I created for the AP Computer Science Principles test. It is a python console application in which you can play tic tac toe with multiple boards. It can be played with 2 players or with an AI. It isn't so much and "AI" as an algorithm that can win whenever it is mathematically possible. This game uses the Mis√®re rules. This means that both players play X's and the first player to make 3 in a row looses. You can play on any board you like. If 3 in a row is made on a board, it is considered dead and you can not play on it. The player that makes the final 3 in a row looses. The the first board is board '0'. The positions of the board are numbered as follows:  

    \|   \|
  0 \| 1 \| 2
 \_\_\_\|\_\_\_\|\_\_\_
    \|   \|
  3 \| 4 \| 5
 \_\_\_\|\_\_\_\|\_\_\_
    \|   \|
  6 \| 7 \| 8
    \|   \|

The algorithm that the computer uses to play against the player is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1672v1.pdf) by Thane E. Plambeck and Greg Whitehead
