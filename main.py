#This is a game of tic tac toe
#This game uses the MisÃ¨re rules
#This means that both players play X's and the first player to make 3 in a row looses
#There can also be multiple boards
#In that case, you can play on any board you like
#But, if 3 in a row is made on a board, it is considered dead and you can not play on it
#The player that makes the final 3 in a row looses
#The the first board is board '0'
#The positions of the board are numbered as follows:

#    |   |
#  0 | 1 | 2
# ___|___|___
#    |   |
#  3 | 4 | 5
# ___|___|___
#    |   |
#  6 | 7 | 8
#    |   |

#The algorithm that the computer uses to play against the player is based on this paper by Thane E. Plambeck and Greg Whitehead:
#https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1672v1.pdf
